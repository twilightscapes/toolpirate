  PIRATE is a haven from the corporate armada, from central rule, and from
  censorship. Every word you scribe and every tale you tell is unequivocally
  yours. It's about sailing under your own flag, following your own chart, and
  staking your claim in the digital world.

  This platform is about building your crew on your terms. Your content is free
  from the manipulations of corporate quartermasters, allowing you to forge
  alliances based on authenticity and shared quests.
