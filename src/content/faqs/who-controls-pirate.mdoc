question: Who controls Pirate?
---
You do! Since Pirate is your own hosted web app, you are in the control of everything. You maintain full copyright and control of all of your content. There is no big brother. There is no Elon or Zuck. The algorithm is determined by you! You determine who you want to see and that is exactly what you see.
